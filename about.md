## About me

I am a software engineer at [Quora](http://www.quora.com), working on machine learning and infrastructure for Quora's personalized feed.

In the past, I was a student at Mines ParisTech and Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure de Cachan, doing an MS in applied mathematics, machine learning and computer vision. I also did some research in machine learning and its applications in audio signal processing and computer vision at INRIA, IRCAM and Caltech. In 2012/2013, I was a software engineering intern at Facebook and Quora. I am also a proficient classical pianist.

I am mainly interested in machine learning and AI, including applications in natural language processing, computer vision, signal processing and robotics.
