## About me

I am a student at Mines ParisTech and Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure de Cachan, doing an MS in applied mathematics, machine learning and computer vision. I am also a hacker, pianist and startup enthusiast.

I am particularly interested in AI, machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing and robotics, but I also enjoy all sorts of software engineering- and hacker-related stuff.
