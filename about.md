## About me

I am student at Mines ParisTech (Paris, France), as well as a hacker, pianist and startup enthusiast.

I am particularly interested in AI, machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing and robotics, but I also enjoy all sorts of software engineering- and hacker-related stuff.
