## Software
[stochs](https://github.com/albietz/stochs): C++ library with Cython bindings for fast stochastic optimization algorithms for machine learning, including stochastic approximation, variance reduction and hybrid algorithms like *stochastic MISO* ([Bietti and Mairal, 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00970)) for handling finite datasets with random perturbations.

[Vowpal Wabbit](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit): Multiple contributions, mostly related to Contextual Bandit algorithms (see [Bietti, Agarwal and Langford, 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04064)).

[RKHS regularization](https://github.com/albietz/kernel_reg): Pytorch package with regularizers based on approximations of the RKHS norm of generic CNNs, for small datasets and adversarial robustness (see [Bietti, Mialon, Chen and Mairal, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00363)).

[qmf](https://github.com/quora/qmf): C++ library for implicit-feedback matrix factorization algorithms. Built with Denis Yarats while at Quora.

[online HMM](https://github.com/albietz/online_hmm): Python/numpy code for online EM algorithms in hidden Markov and semi-Markov models (see [Bietti, Bach and Cont, 2015](files/icassp_online_hmm.pdf)).

[infimnist-py](https://github.com/albietz/infimnist_py): Cython extension for L. Bottou's [infinite MNIST](http://leon.bottou.org/projects/infimnist) dataset generator, along with a Tensorflow queue for real-time data generation.

[dpmm](https://github.com/albietz/dpmm): Variational inference for Dirichlet process mixtures of multinomials, e.g. for text document clustering, in Python/numpy (accompanying report [here](files/dpmixtures.pdf)).
