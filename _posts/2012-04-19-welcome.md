Welcome to my new blog! This website/blog is powered by [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github](http://github.com/) pages.

Code will look nice:
{% highlight python %}
if __name__ == '__main__':
    x = 42
    print 'Hello, {}!'.format('World')
    for i in range(x):
        print i
{% endhighlight %}

as well as inline math ($x = 42$) and equations (thanks to MathJax):

$$ \sum_{k=0}^n k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} $$
