## About

I am a PhD student at Inria in the [Thoth team](http://thoth.inrialpes.fr/) working on machine learning and optimization under the supervision of [Julien Mairal](http://thoth.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/). I am funded by the [MSR-Inria joint center](http://www.msr-inria.fr/).

Previously, I was a software engineer at [Quora](http://www.quora.com), working on machine learning and systems for Quora's ranking products (including the home page feed). Before that, I studied at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure de Cachan and Mines ParisTech, and did my [master's thesis](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01064672v2/document) at Inria and Ircam on online learning algorithms for audio under the supervision of Francis Bach and Arshia Cont. I also [play](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4P07vt1Tmc) [piano](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foh6FXkYyyA).
