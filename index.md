## About

I am a research scientist in the [Center for Computational Mathematics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-mathematics/) at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron). At Flatiron, I am also involved in the [Polymathic AI](https://polymathic-ai.org/) initiative on foundation models for science. Apply [here](https://apply.interfolio.com/155357) to be a research fellow at CCM.

I completed my PhD in December 2019 from Inria and Université Grenoble-Alpes, where I worked in the [Thoth team](http://thoth.inrialpes.fr/) on machine learning and optimization under the supervision of [Julien Mairal](http://thoth.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/), supported by the [MSR-Inria joint center](http://www.msr-inria.fr/).
I was a CDS Faculty Fellow at the [NYU Center for Data Science](http://cds.nyu.edu/) from 2020 to 2022, and a visiting research scientist at [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/research/) in 2022-2023.
I also spent part of 2020 as a postdoc in the [Inria Sierra team](https://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/), hosted by [Francis Bach](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/).
Before my PhD, I was a software engineer at [Quora](http://www.quora.com), working on machine learning and systems for ranking. Before that, I studied at Ecole Normale Supérieure de Cachan and Mines ParisTech, and did my master's thesis at Inria and Ircam with Francis Bach and Arshia Cont. I also [play](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4P07vt1Tmc) [piano](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foh6FXkYyyA).
